# Ad Click Prediction

##  Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a user will click on an online advertisement.
The task is formulated as a binary classification problem based on user behavior data.

The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow implemented
in a single Jupyter Notebook.

## Workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Categorical and numerical feature analysis
- Linear model assumptions check
- Feature selection using mutual information
- Modeling pipeline with regularization
- Model evaluation and error analysis

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## Models
Lasso Logistic Regression, SVC, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost

## Key Result
A regularized logistic regression model using only two numerical features
(Time Spent on Site and Salary) achieved the best balance between performance
and generalization.
